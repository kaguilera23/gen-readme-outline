  ## Description  
  With all the hours of coding dedicated to a single project, sometimes even a single function, the last thing developers want to think about is writing a README. With the README generator, formatting and trying to remember what to write are no longer a  problem. Just answer each question as you would like it on  your file, and at the end, a README worthy of entering for your project will be generated.

  ## Installation  
  Must install Node.js to your computer and must install Inquirer npm package using the command: npm i inquirer@8.2.4. Begin the generator by typing into the terminal: node index.js
